## Welcome to Drop.Info!
We built this website so you can share anything that can fit into an index card with just a short link. Here's a video of how it works:

<br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DnexE53rLw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>

Now that that's out of the way, let us show what you can do with our app.

<br>

## Making a Card
Everything you share on Drop.Info comes in the form of a **card**, which is like a post. To create a card, just go to our [home page](http://drop-info.live/).

<img src="http://drop-info.live/img/imagexkxaru4y.jpeg"></img>

Every card needs a **title** and **contents**. You can put whatever you want in the contents of your card and it will be beautifully displayed in *Markdown*, a text format used in blogging. You can also upload an image and *constrain the text*, which means keeping it in the middle of the page.

<br>

## Markdown Tips
To preview your post in markdown, click the **eye icon** above the contents textbox.  Here's some Markdown basics: (**Tip**: Leave an empty line between every line of text you write!)

<h1>Header</h1>
