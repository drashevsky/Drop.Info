	During this project, we learned a lot more through the internet and research than we'd experienced before. Our skills
from CSE 142 became useful, as well as Kavi's experience in INFO 201 and Daniel's experience with html/css. We learned how
to interact with the terminal, and work on an actual project in a team-based environment through GitHub. Reading, writing,
and saving json files became an important step in the progression of our project, and collaboration became a key instrument
for our success. We also had to use some general teaching skills in order to let the others know what our classes and methods
did, as well as sharing our new information and new ideas we decided to bring into the project. Some enjoyable moments of the
project was researching, especially finding the one source that held a gold mine of information we'd be searching for, and
most of all, watching the finished product unfold and work as we intended was such a spectacular moment. It was challenging
to try to debug our project, since stress levels were exceptionally high and that made enjoying the workflow much more
difficult. The time limit was another contribution to overall stress, especially given that Joel was on airplanes for most
of the first week, and finding a way to start was extremely difficult for us. During this project, we frequently referred
back to notes from other classes, like INFO 201 and CSE 142. Kavi also found a use from geeksforgeeks, which outlined
a lot of ways to read and write json files, and Joel learned a lot about json's strengths and inner workings from json.org,
and StackOverflow. Daniel also found merit in research, though he already had a plan of attack well before the rest of us.
It was very helpful to have someone calling the shots in the beginning, which Daniel had under control. With every group
member given their own delegated role, collaborating and still working on separate parts of the projects became a breeze.
