What did you learn during this project?
Kavi: During this project, I had to re-learn some concepts from previous courses such as CSE 142 and INFO 201. I had to learn how to read, write, and save files as well as work with the terminal, which I was not the most familiar with. Also, I had to work with json libraries and learned how to work with other people in a group, since I have not taken part in very many group computer science projects. In addition, even though I didn't code the server class and use html, I had to obtain a brief understanding of them in order to test and run the project.

What did you enjoy during this project?
Kavi: It was fun to design a new idea and to collaborate with the others.

What did you find challenging or frustrating during this project?
Kavi: Some challenging parts were running into errors during testing and additionally, since there was only 1 or 2 weeks to complete the project, there was a lot of stress to meet deadlines and thus, it was soemtimes hard to enjoy working on the project because of the need to complete it by the deadline. 

What did you find particularly helpful for your learning during this project?
Kavi: For me, the website geeksforgeeks was pretty helpful to better my understanding for reading and writing files. Furthermore, I found it helpeful that my group member Daniel completed a majority of the design and html development as well as delegating the roles to each member so that we all knew our priorities. Also, collaboration in general helped all 3 of us to clarify questions and discuss implementation options.
